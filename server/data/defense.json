      "developing fragmentation cum blast warheads weighing 01- 10 kg that can be dropped from individual Drones or Swarms of Drones. These warheads can neutralise enemy or anti national personnel in open and also neutralise hostile soft skinned targets within a lethal radius of 8-30 m.",
      "The said warheads are being developed with electronic fuzes to ensure effective air burst or detonation on impact. EEL is also developing hexa-copter drones with single or multiple explosive payloads that can be dropped from a height of 300-500 m with an accuracy of 3-5 m at the target end. EEL has developed the competency to develop other variants of warheads to neutralise armoured vehicles, civil or field fortifications employed against us or any other target specified by the users. ",
      "EEL developed warheads can be integrated with drones manufactured by other manufacturers also. Thus we can look at weaponizing drones already held in the inventory or those already in the supply pipeline, of course based on the platform suitability and legal provisions of upgrading the equipment."
